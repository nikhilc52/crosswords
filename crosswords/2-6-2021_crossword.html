It&#39;s a many-headed hydra ... <a id='midCon' class='showmore'>read more</a></div><div class='full' style='display:none'><p>Recently, there has been an effort in the crossword community to get more diverse constructors into the mix. It&#39;s a many-headed hydra of an effort, born of the sense that crosswords have a lot of catching up to do &mdash; with reality, I mean. Some of us are invested in getting more women into the themeless game (to say nothing of getting more women constructors into the mix overall &mdash; and getting more women&#39;s names, interests, and tastes into the grid.) Some of us are also focused on getting more non-white constructors published (and, again, on getting more non-white culture into the grid). Broadly speaking, there&#39;s been a real push to cast a wider net.</p>

<p>Jeff Chen, who runs this site, has expressed support for that movement. As he remarked <a href="/Crossword?date=2/1/2021">on Monday</a>: &quot;I hope we get to the point one day where the records lists will be filled with people of all different backgrounds.&quot; Jeff has regularly mentored constructors, underrepresented and not, for some time now. He has graciously provided a high-quality word list on this website (for a price) that reduces a significant &mdash; truly <em>significant</em> &mdash; barrier to entry for many people. And on top of all of this, which is already a lot, he provides commentary, right here on XWord Info, assessing every daily and Sunday puzzle run by the <em>Times</em>. His column reads &mdash; in sum, and in the broader context of XWord Info &mdash; like a running tutorial on how to make publishable crosswords. This is an effort in line with all of the above.</p>

<p>Rather: It&#39;s an effort that <em>should</em> be in line with all of the above. But here is where we run into problems. To echo the note of my friend and fellow-traveler Erik Agard <a href="/Crossword?date=2/5/2021">on yesterday&#39;s puzzle</a>, this is stuff I&#39;ve said to Jeff in private before, some years and many puzzles ago, regarding some iffy remarks made about names I&#39;d included in a puzzle &mdash; names of Black people that Jeff hadn&#39;t heard of. Jeff was gracious enough <a href="/Crossword?date=11/14/2015">to append an additional note</a> to his comments, conceding: &quot;I personally find it tough to appreciate proper names I don&#39;t know, and I tend not to look them up afterward.&quot;</p>

<p>That&#39;s legitimate &mdash; for the typical solver. But XWord Info is a resource. It is, I quote, &quot;<em>the</em> essential resource for crossword constructors and enthusiasts.&quot; It is the most prominent and comprehensive toolkit available to constructors, both veteran and new, whether they&#39;re interested in submitting to the Times or not. This means that, whether intended to play this role or not, Jeff&#39;s remarks here &mdash; his (literal) tallying of &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; entries; his jokey skepticism toward names (especially ethnic names) and other entries which, with a little Googling, could easily be proven to be known quantities; his implicit weighing of some puzzles against others, with puzzles that dare to include his usual bugbears (broadly: things he does not know; things he worries &quot;solvers&quot; do not know; things he worries will &quot;alienate&quot; solvers) getting slighted in favor of the familiar&hellip; All of this, every bit of it, is a part of XWord Info&#39;s toolkit.</p>

<p>That&#39;s because the commentary here isn&#39;t merely written with the tone of &quot;Just one guy&#39;s opinion&quot; &mdash; though that&#39;s ultimately all it is, in its current form &mdash; but rather with an eye toward instruction. The premise of Jeff&#39;s commentary is, so far as I can gather, twofold:</p>

<ol>
	<li>To give constructors a sense of what makes a crossword viable for publication.</li>
	<li>To give constructors a sense of what &quot;solvers&quot; &mdash; meaning Jeff, extrapolated to stand in for a general public &mdash; might like, or dislike, or find alienating.</li>
</ol>

<p>And it&#39;s within <em>this</em> matrix of concerns, <em>this</em> mission, that a Robyn Weintraub puzzle can be <a href="/Crossword?date=6/21/2019&amp;g=43&amp;d=A">disqualified for Puzzle of the Week status</a> for including the entry CHAKA &mdash; as in Khan, the Grammy-winning, multi-time gold and platinum album-selling, nominated-for-the-Rock-and-Roll-Hall-of-Fame-multiple-times funk legend. This entry is a <em>demerit</em>. Jeff&#39;s reasoning: CHAKA &quot;can only be clued in one way&quot; &mdash; meaning it can only be clued to refer to one person, a person who happens to have written and performed the song &quot;I&#39;m Every Woman.&quot; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVDCNmdi7QI">Yes, that &quot;I&#39;m Every Woman&quot;</a> &mdash; one of the most recognizable songs in American pop/R&amp;B. This is a demerit? This is what we want beginning constructors to think is bad construction?</p>

<p>That&#39;s one example. Obviously, my feelings on this matter are not about any one example, but rather a trend &mdash; a trend that needs to change if we&#39;re going to keep calling this place a resource. If I had to sum up the double standard of Jeff&#39;s commentary here in one binary, it&#39;d be this: Caitlin Reid (rightly!!!!!) <a href="/Crossword?date=3/6/2020">being praised for her constructing &quot;voice&quot;</a> while Ricky Cruz, another wonderful recent addition to the NYT slate, is <a href="/Crossword?date=6/18/2020&amp;g=1&amp;d=D">chastised for his</a>: &quot;I&#39;m curious how many solvers are going to balk at KUBO. Based on his previous puzzles, I get a sense that KUBO [of the Oscar-nominated film KUBO and the Two Strings&quot;] is an expression of Ricky&#39;s personal interests. I don&#39;t know how many solvers will be equally interested and might have a tough time with the name, so I&#39;d leave those types of flourishes out.&quot;</p>

<p>Here&#39;s what&#39;s weird: In Caitlin&#39;s post, Jeff describes voice as what excites him (&quot; &quot;[V]oice&quot; relates to how someone&#39;s work makes you feel. Does it make you happy? Confused in a great, tense way, wanting to read more?&quot;). But the more accurate definition is what he takes Ricky&#39;s puzzle to task for: personal interests, individual style, the things you put in a puzzle that, in addition to being valid, speak to a particular wheelhouse. Not for nothing, but KUBO is only a 4-letter entry, and the crossings &mdash; KARMA / UHAUL / BOTTLENECK / OYSTER &mdash; are more than a little fair. So why the lecture? And much more urgently: Why are some voices more valid, more worthy of praise, than others? Why are we actively encouraging a style more in line with Jeff&#39;s own but actively discouraging (&quot;I&#39;d leave those types of flourishes out&quot;) others? Why are some wheelhouses (those which overlap with Jeff&#39;s, perhaps) examples of <em>better construction</em> than others?</p>

<p>Because: again: This isn&#39;t about Jeff&#39;s personal taste, which is what it is, just as mine is what it is. It&#39;s about how matters of taste can get confused here, on this website that is <em>a resource for constructors</em>, as practical advice about good construction. It&#39;s the way that Jeff wields his taste against constructors whose style bucks &mdash; even just barely bucks; let&#39;s not pretend that the NYT gets that wild &mdash; the cloistered limits of Jeff&#39;s own preferences.</p>

<p>I am tired of how some entries and constructors are accused of &quot;alienating solvers.&quot; It&#39;s a claim that Jeff <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=avast&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk02ticYP0yI8gtgFDQO1C7IMyR08ag%3A1612584665260&amp;ei=2RYeYM60D9LL-gTHz4i4CQ&amp;q=site%3Axwordinfo.com+alienate&amp;oq=site%3Axwordinfo.com+alienate&amp;gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQA1CMSlijaWD9aWgJcAB4AIABaIgB-wWSAQQxMC4xmAEAoAEBqgEHZ3dzLXdpesABAQ&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiOhZKBstTuAhXSpZ4KHccnApcQ4dUDCA0&amp;uact=5">makes too often</a> and applies unevenly, in glaring ways. If Byron Walden&#39;s <a href="/Crossword?date=4/10/2020&amp;g=8&amp;d=D">HEPPLEWHITES</a> &mdash; a great entry! referring to the antique furniture style &mdash; isn&#39;t earning him any lecturing on solvers being &quot;alienated,&quot; then Pete Wentz publishing the far more contemporary <a href="/Crossword?date=8/31/2018&amp;g=51&amp;d=A">TANEHISI COATES</a> (public intellectual; multi-time bestselling author; Macarthur fellow; TV talking head) shouldn&#39;t either. Nor should <a href="/Crossword?date=1/30/2021&amp;g=19&amp;d=A">Nam Jin Yoon publishing COATES</a>, just the last name, become an occasion for Jeff to once again argue for cultural gradualism: &quot;This is by far the best way to work in names like COATES, gently introducing solvers to more recent influential persons. Other puzzles have risked tainting solvers&#39; first associations with someone new to them.&quot;</p>

<p>Call me crazy (you&#39;ll get no argument from me), but what if publishing TaNehisi&#39;s name in full was the point? What if, for that constructor, it&#39;s a way of saying: This is known, this is legitimate, this is <em>different</em>, you&#39;re not a bad person for not knowing it, but now that we&#39;re here, here&#39;s your chance? And what if, in evaluating these entries, Jeff asked, not &quot;Who&#39;s going to feel alienated by this?&quot; but, rather, &quot;Who&#39;ll be excited to see this (whether I, Jeff Chen, am excited or not)?&quot; What if, instead of making a crude FITB game out of <a href="/Crossword?date=3/28/2020&amp;g=37&amp;d=A">Erik Agard&#39;s entry HAUDENOSAUNEE</a> &mdash; an entry that I didn&#39;t know either! &mdash; we take a second to, firstly, note the meaning of that term (Jeff does not) and secondly recognize that, being that it&#39;s clearly the marquee entry, maybe Erik put it there for a reason. And maybe that reason is just as valid as Jeff&#39;s reasons for wanting to avoid that entry &mdash; which, it should be noted, is what Jeff spends a lot more time talking about in his response to Erik&#39;s grid than the entry in itself.</p>

<p>Maybe part of what makes for a good puzzle are choices like these: choices which, whether Jeff cares for them are not, do have solvers in mind &mdash; just not the solvers Jeff seems to think of when he uses that word. But why should the people who feel threatened by these inclusions, who&#39;d &quot;balk&quot; at a 4-letter Japanese name, who&#39;d feel &quot;alienated&quot; by Black culture, have such a stranglehold over Jeff&#39;s sense of what makes for a good puzzle? Why cater to a solver who&#39;d sincerely finish a puzzle with a bad taste in their mouths because &mdash; despite apparently knowing all about HEPPLEWHITES &mdash; they&#39;ve never heard a CHAKA Khan song? Surely we cannot think such a person is the &quot;average solver.&quot; And if they aren&#39;t, why are we always talking about them &mdash; and why do I get the sense that Jeff&#39;s idea of the average solver could never be someone who looked like me, or even Jeff himself?</p>

<p>To reiterate Jeff&#39;s own words: &quot;I hope we get to the point one day where the records lists will be filled with people of all different backgrounds.&quot; A good way of getting there, at least as far as XWord Info is concerned, is by starting to think seriously about questions like these.</p></div></div>

The knock on these puzzles is that they tend to be full of gloopy short fill and/or drab long entries, but excellent results. Amazing job on the first issue &mdash; aside from the ooky EFTS, there&#39;s only a minor EPS.</p>

<div><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catskill_Mountains"><img alt="BORSCHT BELT, a vacation destination!" class="right" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/71/Central_Catskills_from_Twin_south_summit.jpg/600px-Central_Catskills_from_Twin_south_summit.jpg" style="width:466px" title="BORSCHT BELT, a vacation destination!" /></a></div>

<p>More importantly, to get so many great long entries is rare within this themeless subgenre. BORSCHT BELT, HOT WIRING, NO NONSENSE, NO U-TURN, STAR WARS (with a fantastic tour de &quot;force&quot; clue, ha!) &mdash; that&#39;s great stuff. I enjoyed BE PATIENT, DISH IT OUT, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerdcore">NERDCORE</a>, too.</p>

<p>I wasn&#39;t so sure about HERSTORIES. A friend of mine recently rolled her eyes at someone (a guy) for using the word &quot;herstory,&quot; partially because it&#39;s a pass&eacute; term (according to her), and she didn&#39;t like the guy appropriating the word.</p>

<p>Probably didn&#39;t help that he was trying to mansplain it to her.</p>

<p>The rest of the fill ... ENTERIC, SESTET weren&#39;t so great. SATIATED, plus so much of the mid-length material, was more neutral than an asset. There were so many common letters in ENGELS, LISPED, S CLASS, AENEAS, DISSED, and the odd HATTED.</p>

<p>All that said, it&#39;s a standout puzzle within its class. It&#39;s rare to get a themeless so heavy on the 5-6 letter range &mdash; almost half of the total &mdash; so I enjoyed the novelty.</p>

<p><strong>ADDED NOTE:</strong> I had a rough time with all this &mdash; Kameron sprang this on me with no warning, an hour before the puzzle went live, so I had to scramble to process and figure out what to do. Didn&#39;t sleep all night and probably won&#39;t for days. But he has valid points, and so I decided as painful as this would be, it was important to post it all, word for word. I&#39;ve always said this is a site highlighting constructors, and I should live up to that.</p>

<p>Yes, it&#39;s probably best to take my personal opinion, especially as biased and uninformed as it can be, out of the equation. I apologize to Erik, to Kameron, and to whoever else I may have hurt. People ought to feel heard, able to promote their beliefs, and I was inhibiting that.</p></div></div>
