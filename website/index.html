        <div class="center-vertical-box" style="height: 70%;">
            <div class="box-content"><i>The New York Times</i> crossword is a cultural icon. Initially born into the
                <i>Times</i> as a
                means for Americans to escape the gloominess of an impending war in 1942, the crossword has survived for
                more
                than 83 years, and developed a strong following over time.
            </div>
            <div class="box-content">Like learning most things, a large part of solving the crossword is about pattern
                recognition: understanding a crossword theme or filling in missing letters in a familiar word. Patterns
                are also found within crossword construction: both in the grid configuration as well as common clue
                and
                answer pairs. Analyzing that system can help you better understand the crossword and make you a better
                solver.

        <div class="title"><i>About the Data</i></div>

        <div class="box-content">The data for this analysis comes from Nov. 21, 1993 to Jan. 1, 2025, totaling
            11,365
            puzzles and 949,106 clues, from XWordInfo.com, which contains puzzle information for every <i>Times</i>
            crossword
            ever published.</div>
        <div class="box-image-center"><img loading="lazy" src="../analysis/images/crosswords_e.gif"></div>
        <div class="box-content">While the data from 1942 to 1992 is certainly useful, the date restrictions here
            are so
            that the observations are only from the Will Shortz era, when he edited the crossword. This just makes
            the
            stylistic choices of Shortz's puzzles more apparent in the data. </div>
    </div>
    <div class="black-box" style="left: 184vh;">

    <div class="white-box" style="left: 184vh; top: 94vh;">
        <div class="corner-number">3</div>
        <div class="title"><i>Grid Analysis</i></div>

        <div class="box-content">With over 11,365 puzzles in the dataset, there are bound to be repeating tile
            configurations. Below is the most common pattern, which appears 14 times over the last 30 years:</div>

        <div class="split-vertical-box" style="height: 50vh;">
            <img loading="lazy" src="../analysis/images/most_frequent_representation_e.gif">
            <div style="width: 25vh;">This pattern was most recently published on
                December 1st, 2014, so despite it being the most frequent pattern, it's still fairly rare.</div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="white-box" style="left: 184vh; top: 186vh;">
        <div class="corner-number">4</div>
        <div class="box-content" style="padding-top:8vh;">In fact, nearly all of the puzzle tile patterns are unique:
        </div>
        <div class="box-image-center" style="padding-top: 2vh; padding-bottom: 2vh;"><img id="unique-pie-chart"
                loading="lazy" src="../analysis/images/percent_unique_pie_e1.png"></div>
        <div class="box-content">Though this might be the case, there are still important insights to be gained from
            observing the placement of the white and black squares.</div>

    </div>
    <div class="bottom-border" style="left: 276vh; top: 278vh;"></div>
    <div class="white-box" style="left: 184vh; top: 278vh;">
        <div class="corner-number">5</div>
        <div class="box-content">Below is a heatmap of the tile patterns of all 15x15 crosswords in the dataset. Though
            puzzle sizes vary over the week, there are 9,369 crosswords with these dimensions. The scale shows, for each
            tile, what percentage of crosswords have a black square in that location.</div>
        <div class="box-image-center"><img loading=" lazy" src="../analysis/images/heatmap_e.gif" style="height: 42vh;">
        </div>
        <div class="box-content">Notice how all of the corners of the grid are left empty, since one or two-letter
            answers are extremely rare. Instead, there are clear borders around those areas, making three and
            four-letter words dominate those spaces. Nearly all puzzles have rotational symmetry, which helps explain
            the
            pattern of white spaces in the middle, since placing a black square there would mean a one-letter answer
            would need to be in the center of the grid.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="white-box" style="left: 184vh; top: 370vh;">
        <div class="corner-number">6</div>
        <div class="box-content" style="padding-top:6vh;">This pattern does not change much over the years, either.
        </div>
        <div class="box-image-center"><img loading=" lazy" id="heatmap-animation"
                src="../analysis/images/heatmap_animation_e1.png"
                style="padding-top:1vh; height: 45vh; padding-bottom: 2vh;"></div>
        <div class="box-content">Above is the same heatmap, smoothed over each year. Though there is some variance year
            to
            year, as a whole, the same pattern of rotational symmetry and white corners is visible throughout.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="black-box" style="left: 184vh; top:462vh"></div>
    <div class="white-box" style="left: 276vh; top:462vh;">
        <div class="corner-number">7</div>
        <div class="title"><i>Answer Analysis</i></div>

        <div class="box-content">There's plenty of insight to be gained from the text that fills the grid of
            the puzzle, too. Being bound to the constraints of the English language, certain words appear more
            frequently than others because of their flexibility.</div>

        <div class="split-vertical-box" style="height: 50vh;">
            <img loading="lazy" id="common-answers-bar" style="height: 45vh;"
                src="../analysis/images/answer_barplot_e.png">
            <div style="width: 25vh;">Words like ERA, AREA, and ERE all contain common letters, and their length
                makes them extremely useful for puzzle-makers, who employ them in the corners of the grid where longer
                words can't be
                placed. </div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="white-box" style="left: 368vh; top:462vh;">
        <div class="corner-number">8</div>
        <div class="box-content" style="padding-top:8vh;">Word structures that follow a "CVC" pattern, or a consonant,
            followed by a vowel, followed by another consonant, are the most commonly used in puzzle answers. Below is a
            table of the next 4 most frequent sound patterns:
        </div>
        <div class="box-image-center"><img loading=" lazy" src="../analysis/images/cv_table.gif"
                style="padding-top:0vh; padding-bottom: 2vh;"></div>
        <div class="box-content">Again, it follows that these are short words with standard and frequent vowels.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="white-box" style="left: 460vh; top:462vh;">
        <div class="corner-number">9</div>
        <div class="center-vertical-box" style="height: 90%;">
            <div class="box-content">There's some discrepancy in how often the most frequent answers appear in the
                puzzle, based on the day. Generally, the puzzle gets progressively harder over the week, with Monday
                being the easiest and Saturday being the hardest. Sunday, however, is an exception - it's based at a
                Thursday level, but is a lot bigger: 21x21 instead of the standard 15x15.
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="black-box" style="left: 552vh; top:462vh;"></div>
    <div class="white-box" style="left: 552vh; top:370vh;">
        <div class="corner-number">10</div>
        <div class="box-content" style="margin-top:14vh;">One way puzzle makers implement this difficulty is by
            including more novel words, as seen below. On the more difficult days of the week, common words are
            less likely to be seen, whereas early in the week, they're more abundant.
        </div>
        <div class="box-image-center"><img loading=" lazy" style="height: 25vh; margin-top: 4vh;"
                id="common-answers-pie" src="../analysis/images/frequency_by_day.png"
                style="padding-top:2vh; padding-bottom: 2vh;"></div>
        <div class="box-content">Sunday puzzles are an exception to this pattern, since the large size of the grid means
            more clues,
            so common words are more likely to be reused.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="white-box" style="left: 552vh; top:278vh;">
        <div class="corner-number">11</div>
        <div class="box-content" style="margin-top:6vh;">Another way of describing this pattern is by
            looking at the type-token ratio, which describes the lexical diversity of the puzzles by dividing the number
            of unique answers by the total number of answers.
        </div>
        <div class="box-image-center"><img loading=" lazy" id="ttr-line" src="../analysis/images/ttr_year_e.gif"
                style="height: 45vh; padding-bottom: 2vh;"></div>
        <div class="box-content">The advertised difficultly is indeed correlated with lexical diversity: in a given
            year, over 90% of answers are unique between each Saturday variant of the puzzle, compared
            to only 80% with Mondays.

        </div>
        <!-- <div class="box-content">Also, while not shown above, the same is true when grouping years and days together. In a
            Saturday puzzle, you can expect
            8.8% of answers to be new to the <i>Times</i>, but only 3.7% on a Monday version.
        </div> -->
    </div>

    <div class=" white-box" style="left: 552vh; top:186vh;">
        <div class="corner-number">12</div>
        <div class="box-content" style="margin-top:6vh;">Aside from just using new words, puzzle creators also vary
            the length of answers (including spaces) to achieve difficulty.
        </div>
        <div class="box-image-center"><img loading=" lazy" src="../analysis/images/answer_length_table.gif"
                style="height: 45vh; padding-bottom: 2vh;"></div>
        <div class="box-content">Here, the difference in difficulty is clear: more difficult puzzles tend to
            have longer answers. That also means they are less likely to repeat short answers,
            so length and lexical diversity go hand-in-hand.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class=" white-box" style="left: 552vh; top:94vh;">
        <div class="corner-number">13</div>
        <div class="center-vertical-box" style="height: 90%;">
            <div class="box-content">The answers are only one half of the crossword, though: the clues also
                play a vital role in difficulty and completion.
            </div>

            <div class="box-content">For instance, the common answer "SSN" might be paired with a clue like
                "Nine-digit ID" on a Monday (36-Across, 7/24/2006) but a more difficult "Subj. of the Privacy
                Act of 1974" on a Saturday (8-Down, 10/29/2011).
            </div>

            <div class="box-content">As clues vary across days and over the years, they are important to analyze.
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="black-box" style="left: 552vh; top:2vh;"></div>
    <div class="white-box" style="left: 644vh; top:2vh;">
        <div class="corner-number">14</div>
        <div class="title"><i>Clue Analysis</i></div>

        <div class="box-content">Below is an ordered list of the most common clues in the crossword, paired with
            some of their answers.</div>

        <div class="split-vertical-box" style="height: 42vh;">

            <div style="width: 26vh;">Notice that the most common clues are really just ways to access unique
                but
                common answers. From a writer's perspective, a word like ALAI is useful for its short
                length and high concentration of vowels, but there are only so many ways to reference it. Using
                the sport of jai alai is simply the easiest.</div>
            <img loading="lazy" style="height: 42vh;" src="../analysis/images/clue_frequency_pair.png">
        </div>

        <div class="box-content">The same can be said for a clue like "Up", which can be answered with ATBAT,
            ALOFT, or ASTIR. The most common clue, though, is significantly different: it references a
            specific grid location rather than being a descriptor of a word.</div>
    </div>

    <div class=" white-box" style="left: 736vh; top:2vh;">
        <div class="corner-number">15</div>
        <div class="box-content" style="margin-top:2vh;">To understand why 17-Across is so special, take four puzzles
            that feature the clue.
        </div>
        <div class="box-image-center"><img loading=" lazy" src="../analysis/images/17across.gif"
                style="height: 50vh; padding-bottom: 2vh;"></div>
        <div class="box-content">In each of these grids, 17-Across is the first lengthy answer. These longer spaces are
            often used by puzzle makers to create a theme or shared answer, which connects over other, longer answers.
            However, the later clues do not need to repeat the same phrasing as the first, so they default to "See
            17-Across".
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class=" white-box" style="left: 828vh; top:2vh;">
        <div class="corner-number">16</div>
        <div class="box-content" style="margin-top:4vh;">This phenomenon is best understood with an example. The
            17-Across clue in the top right crossword of the previous diagram reads: "With 36- and 59-Across,
            words of Alexander
            Pope." Then, 36- and 59-Across, rather than repeat the same clue, both say "See 17-Across."
            The answers to these three clues are filled in below:
        </div>
        <div class="box-image-center"><img loading=" lazy" src="../analysis/images/feb_27_1996_crossword.gif"
                style="height: 45vh; padding-bottom: 2vh;"></div>
        <div class="box-content">When complete, they reveal a quote stretched across all three answers: "Fools rush in
            where angels fear to tread".
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class=" white-box" style="left: 920vh; top:2vh;">
        <div class="corner-number">17</div>
        <div class="center-vertical-box" style="height: 90%;">
            <div class="box-content">Intricacies like this are what make both completing and analyzing crosswords so
                fulfilling.
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="black-box" style="left: 1012vh; top:2vh;"></div>

    <div class=" white-box" style="left: 1012vh; top:94vh;">
        <div class="corner-number">18</div>
        <div class="box-content" style="margin-top:8vh;">Honing down to just the most common clue-answer pairs
            yields a
            slightly different result.
        </div>
        <div class="split-vertical-box" style="height: 50vh; padding-top: 2vh;">

            <img loading="lazy" style="height: 50vh;" src="../analysis/images/clue_answer_pair_table.gif">
            <div style="width: 25vh;">The insight remains the same: common answers like SRI and
                UMA can only be reached in certain ways, which leads to repeated clues for those words.</div>

        </div>
    </div>

    <div class=" white-box" style="left: 1012vh; top:186vh;">
        <div class="corner-number">19</div>
        <div class="box-content" style="margin-top:6vh;">Interestingly, there's been a clear trend in how the
            <i>Times</i>
            chooses their clues: over the years, the average length of clues, in terms of the total number of characters
            (including spaces), has consistently increased, with little variation across different days:
        </div>
        <div class="box-image-center"><img loading=" lazy" src="../analysis/images/clue_length_e.gif"
                style="height: 40vh; padding-bottom: 2vh;"></div>
        <div class="box-content">It's unclear whether this corresponds with a particular change in difficulty. On one
            hand, longer clues increase context for an answer, but on the other, they can also increase complexity.
            Regardless, it's fascinating to see such a clear trend across time. </div>
    </div>

    <div class=" black-box" style="left: 1012vh; top:278vh;"> </div>

    <div class=" white-box" style="left: 1104vh; top:278vh;">
        <div class="corner-number">20</div>
        <div class="box-content" style="margin-top:2vh;">The <i>Times</i> crossword employs a lot of conventions in
            their
            clues. One of them pertains to clues enclosed in quotes ("..."). According to the <i>Times</i>, a clue
            written in
            this manner is "something someone might say out loud" and its answer is "a synonym for that
            verbalization".


        </div>

        <div class="box-content" style="margin-top:0vh;">For instance, a clue like "I goofed"
            has the answer MYBAD. The most common verbalizations are listed below:
        </div>
        <div class="box-image-center"><img loading=" lazy" src="../analysis/images/quote_answer_frequency_e.gif"
                style="transform: rotate(90deg); height: 45vh; padding-bottom: 2vh;"></div>
        <div class="box-content">Knowing the common answers to such clues can aid in solving: 72.4% of puzzles contain
            at
            least one of these "quote" clues.</div>
    </div>

    <div class=" white-box" style="left: 1196vh; top:278vh;">
        <div class="corner-number">21</div>
        <div class="box-content" style="margin-top:6vh;">Another convention of the crossword is clues that start
            and end with a square bracket ([...]). For these, the clues suggest answers that are non-verbal: a clue
            like "[Get the joke?]" can be answered with WINK.

            Again, below are the most common answers:
        </div>
        <div class="box-image-center"><img loading=" lazy" src="../analysis/images/brackets_answer_frequency_e.gif"
                style="transform: rotate(90deg); height: 45vh; padding-bottom: 2vh;"></div>
        <div class="box-content">While these types of clues appear in only 5% puzzles, whenever they do appear, it will
            be easy
            to draw upon the above word bank to solve. </div>
    </div>

    <div class=" white-box" style="left: 1288vh; top:278vh;">
        <div class="corner-number">22</div>
        <div class="box-content" style="margin-top:2vh;">There are also less "formal" quirks found within
            crossword clues, mainly revolving around their wording. Below is a table of the most frequently used
            first words (including special characters) in <i>Times</i> clues. A sample clue of each type is appended
            in gray:
        </div>
        <div class="box-image-center"><img loading=" lazy" src="../analysis/images/first_words.gif"
                style="height: 45vh; padding-bottom: 1vh;"></div>
        <div class="box-content">To the untrained solver, these clues can seem purposefully confusing. However,
            they are really just ways for writers to reach certain types of words: adjectives are paired with
            clues that begin with "Like" ("Like much of Sudan": ARID) and clues that start with "Kind" are

        <div class="box-content">Other endings like "say", "maybe", and "in a way" can vary in their use cases, but

        <div class="box-content" style="margin-top:2vh;">Though it might seem like the crossword follows a certain
            formula, there is still plenty of room for growth. For instance, the references that the Times makes in
            their clues have significantly varied over time:
        </div>
        <div class="box-image-center"><img loading=" lazy" src="../analysis/images/adele_e.gif" style="height: 45vh;">
        </div>
        <div class="box-content">Take the above chart, which shows the person referenced by clues that had the answer ADELE.
            Before Adele (the singer) became a household name, the answer was still used in the crossword for its
            relatively short length and high vowel count, with references to other (lesser-known) Adeles. But after
            Adele began releasing albums, the crossword clues immediately pivoted to utilizing her identity
            as a sole reference.</div>

    <div class=" white-box" style="left: 1564vh; top:462vh;">
        <div class="corner-number">26</div>
        <div class="box-content" style="margin-top:8vh;">Even still, answers also have the potential for variance over
            time.

        <div class="box-image-center"><img loading=" lazy" src="../analysis/images/serena.gif"
                style="height: 38vh; padding: 2vh;">
        </div>
        <div class="box-content">While not as common an answer as ADELE, likely for its slightly longer length and
            lower vowel density, SERENA has appeared 39 times after Serena Williams (the tennis player) won the U.S.
            Open in 1999. More importantly, SERENA hadn't appeared once in the six years prior to her stepping onto
            the global stage: it was solely her likeness that propelled the consistent use of the answer in the
            crossword.</div>

            <div class="box-content">These answers in particular showcase the power of the crossword as an ever-evolving
                representation of current culture. It's nice to see people, places, and things you know get featured in
                these puzzles.
