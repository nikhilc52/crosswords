            <div class="box-content">The New York Times crossword is a cultural icon. Initially born into the Times as a
                means for Americans to escape the gloominess of an impeding war in 1942, the crossword has survived for
                more
                than 83 years, and developed a strong following over time.
            </div>
            <div class="box-content">Like learning most things, a large part of solving the crossword is about pattern
                recognition: understanding a crossword theme or filling in missing letters in a familiar word. Patterns
                can
                also be found within crossword construction as well: in the grid configuration as well as common clue
                and
                answers pairs. Analyzing that system can help you better understand the crossword and make you a better
                solver.

        <div class="box-content">The data for this analysis comes from Nov. 21, 1993 to Jan. 1, 2025, totaling
            11,365
            puzzles and 949,106 clues, from XWordInfo.com, which contains puzzle information for every Times
            crossword
            ever published.</div>
        <div class="box-image-center"><img loading="lazy" src="../analysis/images/crosswords_e.gif"></div>
        <div class="box-content">While the data from 1942 to 1992 is certainly useful, the date restrictions here
            are so
            that the observations are only from the Will Shortz era, where he edited the crossword. This just makes
            the
            stylistic choices of Shortz's puzzles more apparent in the data. </div>

        <div class="title"><i>Grid Analysis</i></div>

        <div class="box-content">With over 11,365 puzzles in the dataset, there are bound to be repeating tile
            configurations. Below is the most common pattern, which has appeared 14 times over the last 30 years:</div>

        <div class="split-vertical-box" style="height: 50vh;">
            <img loading="lazy" src="../analysis/images/most_frequent_representation_e.gif">
            <div style="width: 25vh;">This pattern was most recently published on
                December 1st, 2014, so despite it being the most frequent pattern, it's still fairly rare.</div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="white-box" style="left: 184vh; top: 186vh;">
        <div class="corner-number">4</div>
        <div class="box-content" style="padding-top:8vh;">In fact, nearly all of the puzzle tile patterns are unique:
        </div>
        <div class="box-image-center" style="padding-top: 2vh; padding-bottom: 2vh;"><img id="unique-pie-chart"
                loading="lazy" src="../analysis/images/percent_unique_pie_e1.png"></div>
        <div class="box-content">Though this might be the case, there are still important insights to be gained from
            observing the placement of the white and black tiles.</div>

    </div>
    <div class="bottom-border" style="left: 276vh; top: 278vh;"></div>
    <div class="white-box" style="left: 184vh; top: 278vh;">
        <div class="corner-number">5</div>
        <div class="box-content">Below is a heatmap of the tile patterns of all 15x15 crosswords in the dataset. Though
            puzzle sizes vary over the week, there's 9,369 crosswords with these dimensions. The scale shows, for each
            tile, what percentage of crosswords had a black square in that location.</div>
        <div class="box-image-center""><img loading=" lazy" src="../analysis/images/heatmap_e.gif"></div>
        <div class="box-content">Notice how all of the corners of the grid are left empty, since one or two letter
            answers are extremely rare. Instead, there are clear borders around those areas, making three and four
            letter words dominate those spaces. Nearly all puzzles have rotational symmetry, that helps explain the
            pattern of white spaces in the middle, since placing a black square there would mean a one letter answer
            would need to be in the center of the grid.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="white-box" style="left: 184vh; top: 370vh;">
        <div class="corner-number">6</div>
        <div class="box-content" style="padding-top:8vh;">This pattern has not changed much over the years, either.
        </div>
        <div class="box-image-center""><img loading=" lazy" id="heatmap-animation"
            src="../analysis/images/heatmap_animation_e1.png" style="padding-top:2vh; padding-bottom: 2vh;"></div>
        <div class="box-content">Above is the same heatmap, smoothed over each year. Though there is some variance year
            to
            year, as a whole, the same pattern of rotational symmetry and white corners is visible throughout.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="black-box" style="left: 184vh; top:462vh"></div>
    <div class="white-box" style="left: 276vh; top:462vh;">
        <div class="corner-number">7</div>
        <div class="title"><i>Answer Analysis</i></div>

        <div class="box-content">There is plenty of insight to be gained from the text that actually fills the grid of
            the puzzle, too. Being bound to the constraints of the English language, certain words appear more
            frequently than others because of their flexibility.</div>

        <div class="split-vertical-box" style="height: 50vh;">
            <img loading="lazy" id="common-answers-bar" style="height: 45vh;"
                src="../analysis/images/answer_barplot_e.png">
            <div style="width: 25vh;">Words like ERA, AREA, and ERE all contain very common letters, and their length
                makes them extremely useful for puzzle-makers, who use them in the corners of the grid where longer
                words can't be
                placed. </div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="white-box" style="left: 368vh; top:462vh;">
        <div class="corner-number">8</div>
        <div class="box-content" style="padding-top:8vh;">Word structures that follow a "CVC" pattern, or a consonant,
            followed by a vowel, followed by another consonant, are the most commonly used in puzzle answers. Below is a
            table of the next 4 most frequent sound patterns:
        </div>
        <div class="box-image-center""><img loading=" lazy" src="../analysis/images/cv_table.gif"
            style="padding-top:2vh; padding-bottom: 2vh;"></div>
        <div class="box-content">Again, it follows suit that these are short words with standard and frequent vowels.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="white-box" style="left: 460vh; top:462vh;">
        <div class="corner-number">9</div>
        <div class="center-vertical-box" style="height: 90%;">
            <div class="box-content">There's some discrepancy in how often the most frequent answers appear in the
                puzzle, based on the day. Generally, the puzzle gets progressively harder over the week, with Monday
                being the easiest and Saturday being the hardest. Sunday, however, is an exception - it's based at a
                Thursday level, but is a lot bigger: 21x21 instead of the standard 15x15.
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="black-box" style="left: 552vh; top:462vh;"></div>
    <div class="white-box" style="left: 552vh; top:370vh;">
        <div class="corner-number">10</div>
        <div class="box-content" style="margin-top:14vh;">One way that the puzzle makers implement this difficulty is by
            including more novel words, as seen below. On the more difficult days of the week, common words are
            less likely to be seen, whereas early in the week, they're more abundant.
        </div>
        <div class="box-image-center""><img loading=" lazy" style="height: 25vh; margin-top: 4vh;"
            id="common-answers-pie" src="../analysis/images/frequency_by_day.png"
            style="padding-top:2vh; padding-bottom: 2vh;"></div>
        <div class="box-content">Sunday puzzles are an exception to this pattern, since the large size of the grid means
            more clues,
            so common words are more likely to be reused.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="white-box" style="left: 552vh; top:278vh;">
        <div class="corner-number">11</div>
        <div class="box-content" style="margin-top:6vh;">Another way of describing this repetition pattern is by
            looking at the type-token ratio, which describes the lexical diversity of the puzzles by dividing the number
            of unique answers by the total number of answers.
        </div>
        <div class="box-image-center""><img loading=" lazy" id="ttr-line" src="../analysis/images/ttr_year_e.gif"
            style="height: 45vh; padding-bottom: 2vh;"></div>
        <div class="box-content"">Notice that there isn't much variation within each day over the years, 
            and that the advertised difficulty of each puzzle is indeed correlated with its type-token ratio measurement, 
            except for Sunday, due to its aforementioned anomalous size.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class=" white-box" style="left: 552vh; top:186vh;">
            <div class="corner-number">12</div>
            <div class="box-content" style="margin-top:6vh;">Aside from just using new words, puzzle creators also vary
                the length of answers to achieve difficulty.
            </div>
            <div class="box-image-center""><img loading=" lazy" id="ttr-line"
                src="../analysis/images/answer_length_table.gif" style="height: 45vh; padding-bottom: 2vh;"></div>
            <div class="box-content"">Here, the difference in difficulty is clear: more difficult puzzles tend to
                 have longer answers. That also means they are less likely to repeat short answers, 
                 so length and lexical diversity go hand-in-hand.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class=" white-box" style="left: 552vh; top:94vh;">
                <div class="corner-number">13</div>
                <div class="center-vertical-box" style="height: 90%;">
                    <div class="box-content">The answers are only one half of the crossword, though: the clues also
                        play a vital role in difficulty and completion.
                    </div>

                    <div class="box-content">For instance, a common answer like "SSN" might be paired with a clue like
                        "Nine-digit ID" on a Monday (36-Across, 7/24/2006) but a more difficult "Subj. of the Privacy
                        Act of 1974" on a Saturday (8-Down, 10/29/2011).
                    </div>

                    <div class="box-content">As the clues vary across days and over the years, there's a lot of acumen
                        to be gained from the crossword when analyzing
                        its clues.
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
