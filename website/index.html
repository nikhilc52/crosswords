            <div class="box-content">The New York Times crossword is a cultural icon. Initially born into the Times as a
                means for Americans to escape the gloominess of an impeding war in 1942, the crossword has survived for
                more
                than 83 years, and developed a strong following over time.
            </div>
            <div class="box-content">Like learning most things, a large part of solving the crossword is about pattern
                recognition: understanding a crossword theme or filling in missing letters in a familiar word. Patterns
                can
                also be found within crossword construction as well: in the grid configuration as well as common clue
                and
                answers pairs. Analyzing that system can help you better understand the crossword and make you a better
                solver.

        <div class="box-content">The data for this analysis comes from Nov. 21, 1993 to Jan. 1, 2025, totaling
            11,365
            puzzles and 949,106 clues, from XWordInfo.com, which contains puzzle information for every Times
            crossword
            ever published.</div>
        <div class="box-image-center"><img loading="lazy" src="../analysis/images/crosswords_e.gif"></div>
        <div class="box-content">While the data from 1942 to 1992 is certainly useful, the date restrictions here
            are so
            that the observations are only from the Will Shortz era, where he edited the crossword. This just makes
            the
            stylistic choices of Shortz's puzzles more apparent in the data. </div>

        <div class="box-content">With over 11,365 puzzles in the dataset, there are bound to be repeating tile
            configurations. Below is the most common pattern, which has appeared 14 times over the last 30 years:</div>

        <div class="split-vertical-box" style="height: 50vh;">
            <div><img loading="lazy" src="../analysis/images/most_frequent_representation_e.gif">
            </div>
            <div style="width: 25vh;">This pattern was most recently published on
                December 1st, 2014, so despite it being the most frequent pattern, it's still fairly rare.</div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="white-box" style="left: 184vh; top: 186vh;">
        <div class="corner-number">4</div>
        <div class="box-content" style="padding-top:8vh;">In fact, nearly all of the puzzle tile patterns are unique:
        </div>
        <div class="box-image-center" style="padding-top: 2vh; padding-bottom: 2vh;"><img id="unique-pie-chart"
                loading="lazy" src="../analysis/images/percent_unique_pie_e1.png"></div>
        <div class="box-content">Though this might be the case, there are still important insights to be gained from
            observing the placement of the white and black tiles.</div>

    </div>
    <div class="bottom-border" style="left: 276vh; top: 278vh;"></div>
    <div class="white-box" style="left: 184vh; top: 278vh;">
        <div class="corner-number">5</div>
        <div class="box-content">Below is a heatmap of the tile patterns of all 15x15 crosswords in the dataset. Though
            puzzle sizes vary over the week, there's 9,369 crosswords with these dimensions. The scale shows, for each
            tile, what percentage of crosswords had a black square in that location.</div>
        <div class="box-image-center""><img loading=" lazy" src="../analysis/images/heatmap_e.gif"></div>
        <div class="box-content">Notice how all of the corners of the grid are left empty, since one or two letter
            answers are extremely rare. Instead, there are clear borders around those areas, making three and four
            letter words dominate those spaces. Nearly all puzzles have rotational symmetry, that helps explain the
            pattern of white spaces in the middle, since placing a black square there would mean a one letter answer
            would need to be in the center of the grid.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="white-box" style="left: 184vh; top: 370vh;">
        <div class="corner-number">6</div>
        <div class="box-content" style="padding-top:8vh;">This pattern has not changed much over the years, either.
        </div>
        <div class="box-image-center""><img loading=" lazy" id="heatmap-animation"
            src="../analysis/images/heatmap_animation_e1.png" style="padding-top:2vh; padding-bottom: 2vh;"></div>
        <div class="box-content">Above is the same heatmap, smoothed over each year. Though there is some variance year
            to
            year, as a whole, the same pattern of rotational symmetry and white corners is visible throughout.</div>
