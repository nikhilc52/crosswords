                Thursday level, but is a lot bigger: 21x21 instead of the standard 15x15.

        <div class="corner-number">10</div>
        <div class="box-content" style="margin-top:14vh;">One way puzzle makers implement this difficulty is by
            <span class="highlight">including more novel words</span>, as seen below. On the more difficult days of the
            week, common words are
            less likely to be seen, whereas early in the week, they're more abundant.

                style="padding-top:2vh; padding-bottom: 2vh;"></div>
        <div class="box-content">Sunday puzzles are an exception to this pattern, since the large size of the grid means
            more clues,
            so common words are more likely to be reused.

    <div class="white-box" style="left: 552vh; top:278vh;" id="14.0">
        <div class="corner-number">11</div>
        <div class="box-content" style="margin-top:6vh;">Another way of describing this pattern is by
            looking at the <span class="highlight">type-token ratio</span>, which describes the lexical diversity of the
            puzzles by dividing the number
            of unique answers by the total number of answers.

        <div class="box-content">The advertised difficultly is indeed correlated with lexical diversity: in a given
            year, over 90% of answers are unique between each Saturday variant of the puzzle, compared
            to only 80% with Mondays.<sup id="ttr">v</sup>

        </div>

        <div class="tooltip" id="ttr-desc">Also, while not shown above, the same is true when grouping years and days
            together. In a
            Saturday puzzle, you can expect
            8.8% of answers to be new to the <i>Times</i> (never used in any crossword), but only 3.7% on a Monday

        <div class="tooltip" id="answer-length-desc">The length is the number of characters, including

            <div style="width: 26vh;">Notice that the most common clues are really just ways to access unique
                but
                common answers. From a writer's perspective, a word like ALAI is useful for its short
                length and high concentration of vowels, but there are only so many ways to reference it. Using
                the sport of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jai_alai" target="_blank" class="link">jai alai</a>
                is simply the easiest.</div>

        </div>

        <div class="box-content">The same can be said for a clue like "Up", which can be answered with ATBAT,
            ALOFT, or ASTIR. The most common clue, though, is significantly different: <span class="highlight">it
                references a
                specific grid location rather than being a descriptor of a word</span>.</div>

        <div class="corner-number">15</div>
        <div class="box-content" style="margin-top:2vh;">To understand why 17-Across is so special, take four puzzles
            that feature the clue.

                style="height: 50vh; padding-bottom: 2vh;"></div>
        <div class="box-content">In each of these grids, 17-Across is <span class="highlight">the first lengthy
                answer</span>. These longer spaces are
            often used by puzzle makers to create a theme or shared answer, which connects over other, longer answers.
            However, the later clues do not need to repeat the same phrasing as the first, so they default to "See
            17-Across".<sup id="17-across">vii</sup>
        </div>

        <div class="tooltip" id="17-across-desc">Other clues the exhibit the same pattern are "See 1-Across" (74
            appearances) and "See 20-Across" (50 appearances).
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="white-box" style="left: 828vh; top:2vh;" id="20.0">
        <div class="corner-number">16</div>
        <div class="box-content" style="margin-top:4vh;">This phenomenon is best understood with an example. The
            17-Across clue in the top right crossword of the previous diagram reads: "With 36- and 59-Across,
            words of Alexander
            Pope." Then, 36- and 59-Across, rather than repeat the same clue, both say "See 17-Across."

                class="link">According to the <i>Times</i></a>, a clue
            written in

                for that
                verbalization"</span>.
        </div>

        <div class="box-content" style="margin-top:0vh;">For instance, a clue like "I goofed"
            has the answer MYBAD. The most common verbalizations are listed below:

        <div class="box-image-center"><img loading="lazy" id="quote-answer"

        <div class="box-content">Knowing the common answers to such clues can aid in solving: <span

        <div class="corner-number">21</div>
        <div class="box-content" style="margin-top:6vh;">Another convention of the crossword is clues that start
            and end with a square bracket ([...]). For these, the clues suggest answers that are <span
                class="highlight">non-verbal</span> a clue

            crossword clues, mainly revolving around their wording. Below is a table of the most frequently used

            clues that begin with "Like" ("Like much of Sudan": ARID) and clues that start with "Kind" are
            answered with prefixes ("Kind of bean": SOY), for instance.</div>

        <div class="box-content">Other endings like "say", "maybe", and "in a way" can vary in their use cases, but

            became a household name, the answer was still used in the crossword for its

        <div class="box-content">While not as common an answer as ADELE, likely for its slightly longer length and
